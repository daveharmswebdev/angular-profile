			<h2>Backstory</h2>
			<p>Lorem ipsum, just kidding. Where’s the appropriate place to start? When I first got out of college I faked my way into an IT job. I wrote a timecard app. It was in VB. It had a GUI where you entered in hours for employees at a restaurant that was owned by this large mom and pop business that, aside from restaurants and convenience stores, owned fleet fuel and HVAC departments. That program spit out a text file that got loaded into payroll program and it fooled the owners into thinking I knew something about computers. I spent the next five years being a jack of all trades, networking, hardware, software, tech support, etc. Tech support was my favorite, I loved helping people. That inspired me into getting into nursing. 
			</p>
			<p>Nursing has been good to me. And I want very badly to be good to nursing. And I think I can do that through IT. Nurses need help; they need better IT. Healthcare needs more nurses involved in software projects. And that’s where I want to be. 
			</p>
			<p>I know the workflow on the floor. I know the human, physical story behind assessment, medication, and treatment. I can look at the data and see a face.

			<h2>Nashville</h2>
			<p>When I was a student at nursing school in Richmond I would visit my parents in Thompson Station, which is about 30 minutes south on 65. And I just loved it here. I moved after graduation. That was in 2009. And life has been great. I’ve had an excellent career as a nurse. I met my wife here, started a family. I love the weather here, it’s never as cold as Massachusetts, where I was raised. And it’s never as hot as Texas, where I went to college. I have rental property in East Nashville, in-laws in Clarksville, and my parents in the south. So I’m pretty rooted here.</p>

			<h2>Coding</h2>
			<p>
				…is fun. It is fun to create, whether it’s wood, Legos or JavaScript. And it doesn’t matter whether it’s front end or back end, it’s still code that when translated becomes something else other than the “&” or “let” or “=>” or…whatever.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I first started NSS I said to myself, that I was a “backend” guy and that “frontend” guys were kids who wore skinny jeans, loved Adobe products and listened to “Fleet Foxes.”  Now I see that back end and front end challenges, while different, both fall under the umbrella that is software development; therefore, they are the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				I love solving problems. Sure, I love elegant code. I geek out on ECMA6 and fat arrows and the lexical this. But I love the solution realized. At NSS I haven’t really experienced that, yet. The closest I’ve gotten is having a Nursing friend of mine test out a web app. He found a bug, I looked at my Heroku logs when he triggered it. I fixed the code, pushed it back up, and then used my app again bug free. That gave me a better feeling then writing the shortest, most ninja, inline, chained, array object code I’ve ever come up with.
			</p>
			<p>
				So to circle back around. Coding is fun, but creating something useful is divine.
