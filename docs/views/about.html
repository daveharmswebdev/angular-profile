			<h2>Backstory</h2>
			<p>Lorem ipsum, just kidding. Where’s the appropriate place to start? When I first got out of college I faked my way into an IT job. I wrote a timecard app. It was in VB. It had a GUI where you entered in hours for employees at a restaurant that was owned by this large mom and pop business that, aside from restaurants and convenience stores, owned fleet fuel and HVAC departments. That program spit out a text file that got loaded into payroll program and it fooled the owners into thinking I knew something about computers. I spent the next five years being a jack of all trades, networking, hardware, software, tech support, etc. Tech support was my favorite, I loved helping people. That inspired me into getting into nursing. 
			</p>
			<p>Nursing has been good to me. And I want very badly to be good to nursing. And I think I can do that through IT. Nurses need help; they need better IT. Healthcare needs more nurses involved in software projects. And that’s where I want to be. 
			</p>
			<p>I know the workflow on the floor. I know the human, physical story behind assessment, medication, and treatment. I can look at the data and see a face.

			<h2>Nashville</h2>
			<p>When I was a student at nursing school in Richmond I would visit my parents in Thompson Station, which is about 30 minutes south on 65. And I just loved it here. I moved after graduation. That was in 2009. And life has been great. I’ve had an excellent career as a nurse. I met my wife here, started a family. I love the weather here, it’s never as cold as Massachusetts, where I was raised. And it’s never as hot as Texas, where I went to college. I have rental property in East Nashville, in-laws in Clarksville, and my parents in the south. So I’m pretty rooted here.</p>
